considered for re‐election to a term of one to three years, staggered in order to ensure future
orderly transition on the Board. Nominees recommended by the nominating committee may
volunteer for the newly staggered terms for the first election. If the staggered terms are not
evenly distributed, then the Executive Committee will assign Trustees to terms to make them
evenly staggered. Newly added members of the Board of Directors shall serve until the next
regularly scheduled election unless the resulting term would be less than six months in which
case they would serve until the second regularly scheduled election and then if eligible for an

thereafter, the Board shall select a nominations committee to present a list to the Board of
Trustees containing names of eligible nominees as Trustees for the ensuing year. Said list shall
contain the names of at least one eligible nominee to each vacancy. In case the Board of
