Users of the BBU, namely Issuers and Verifiers of digital credentials, expect a level of assurance pertaining to the reliability and integrity of the ledger. Those users who are members of the Bedrock Consortium have a vested interest understanding the level of assurance that can be assigned to the BBU. Those users who seek public read-only access for verification purposes also desire an understanding the level of assurance to help set business verification polices but they do not have a stake in the n Assurance Requirements \u00b6 The BBU aspires to ensure reliability, low processing latency, and a maximum uptime of the service. The Level of Assurance that can be asserted by the BBU Governance Framework will evolve over time depending on a number of factors including: Member Compliance Adherence to technical and operating policies operating policies Contract status Ledger Reliability Probability that verification requests (ledger reads) will operate without failure for a specified number of transactions or for a specified period of time and within an acceptable response-time. Probability that transaction author requests (ledger writes) will operate without failure for a specified number of transactions or for a specified period of time and within an acceptable response-time. Ecosystem Trust Factor As the BBU matures towards a production ready and actively used ledger, the degree of assurance measures that will be in place will vary.

Versioning \u00b6 Each version of this document is tied to the BBU Governance Framework at a specific point of time. Terminology \u00b6 All terms in First Letter Capitals that are not defined in this document (as called out in a specific section) are defined in the Glossary . Purpose \u00b6 The purpose of the BBU Trust AssuranceFramework is to identify: The Trust Elements that Trust Actors assert in relationship to the BBU. The The BBU Roles that assert and rely upon trust. Generally-Accepted, Bedrock-Specific, or Domain-Specific Trust Criteria used in the evaluation of trust associated with the BBU. The Trust Assertions that BBU Roles make against Trust Criteria. The Trust Evidence that Trust Actors produce to create assurance regarding their trust assertions. The Trust Mechanisms in place to assert and evaluate trust. The process of Trust Governance whereby trust assertions are evaluated and deemed trustworthy, so they can be relied upon by Relying Parties (BBU Consumers). Level of Assurance \u00b6 This document describes the Level of Assurance a Relying Party can derive from the BBU Governance Framework. This section defines the maximum level. The BBU Governance Framework claims a maximum level of a reasonable Level of Assurance. In May 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)updated its Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (the original framework). The original framework has gained broad acceptance and is widely used around the world. It is recognized as a leading framework for designing, implementing, and conducting internal control and assessing the effectiveness of internal control. Internal control is defined as follows: Internal control is a process, effected by an entity\u2019s board of directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives relating to operations, reporting, and compliance. This definition reflects certain fundamental concepts. Internal control is: Geared to the achievement of objectives in one or more categories\u2014operations, reporting, and compliance A process consisting of ongoing tasks and activities\u2014a means to an end, not an end in itself Effected by people\u2014not merely about policy and procedure manuals, systems, and forms, but about people and the actions they take at every level of an organization to affect internal control Able to provide reasonable assurance\u2014but not absolute assurance, to an entity\u2019s senior management and board of directors Adaptable to the entity structure\u2014flexible in application for the entire entity or for a particular subsidiary, division, operating unit, or business process This definition is intentionally broad. It captures important concepts fundamental to how organizations design, implement, and conduct internal control, providing a basis for application across organizations that operate in different entity structures, industries, and geographic regions. The ICAEW definition of a reasonable assurance audit engagement is: Where the practitioner needs to reduce the assurance engagement risk (the risk that an inappropriate conclusion is expressed when the information on the subject matter is materially misstated) to an acceptably low level as the basis for a positive form of expression of the practitioner\u2019s conclusion. Such risk is never reduced to nil and therefore, there can never be absolute assurance. Per the ICAEW guidance on management of risk and liability , relying parties may perceive less than reasonable assurance based on their evaluation of the BBU Governance Framework and the BBU Trust AssuranceFramework but not more. Trust Elements \u00b6 The following Trust Elements guide the development of specific Trust Criteria asserted by Trust Actors in the BBU. These are based on the AICPA Trust Services Criteria based on COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework, for use in attestation or consulting engagements to evaluate and report on controls over information and systems (a) across an entire entity; (b) at a subsidiary, division, or operating unit level; (c) within a function relevant to the entity's operational, reporting, or compliance objectives; or (d) for a particular type of information used by the entity. Security. Information and systems are protected against unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure of information, and damage to systems that could compromise the availability, integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of information or systems and affect the entity\u2019s ability to meet its objectives. Availability. Information and systems are available for operation and used to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. Processing integrity . System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. Confidentiality. Information designated as confidential is protected to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. Privacy. Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed to meet the entity\u2019s objectives. BBU Roles Making Trust Assertions \u00b6 The following BBU Roles make Trust Assertions with regard to the Trust Elements to Relying Parties within the Bedrock Community: Bedrock Consortium (including the Board of Directors). Steward. Trust Criteria \u00b6 Bedrock-Specific Trust Criteria \u00b6 For the BBU Governance Framework, the only Trust Criteria in operation are self-developed by the Bedrock Consortium and appear in section 10 and in an Addendum to that document. It comprises governance Policies the Bedrock Consortium has set for itself and the Bedrock Member Business Policies and Bedrock Member Technical Policies it mandates for Stewards. Trust Evidence \u00b6 Trust assertions are empty without evidence to support it. The following are examples of Trust Evidence that are used to support Trust Assertions for the BBU Governance Framework. Signed Contracts. Signed Agreements. Configurations. Signed Approvals. Policies. Procedures. Logs. a. Security. b. Application. c. System. d. Database. Incident Records \u00b6 For the BBU Governance Framework, see the Trust Assurance Matrix (Addendum) for the specific Trust Evidence used in this version of the BBU Trust AssuranceFramework. Trust Actors \u00b6 The following is the set of Sovrin Entities who play a role in the Sovrin Governance Framework in assessing and opining on Trust Assertions in the Sovrin Network. Bedrock Board of Directors. Issues the Policies within the Sovrin Governance Framework and has the right to approve and suspend Stewards from the Sovrin Network. It has the right to perform Self-Certification to evoke assurance from Relying Parties. Stewards. Agree to the Sovrin Steward Agreement and perform Self-Certification of compliance with the Steward Business Policies and Steward Technical Policies. Legal Authorities. Enforce laws in the Jurisdictions of the Sovrin Foundation and Stewards and mediates the Sovrin Steward Agreement if challenged. Trust Mechanisms \u00b6 The following are actions that the Sovrin Foundation takes to assert and assure trust: Contracts and Agreements Self-Assertion a. Sovrin Trust Criteria Compliance b. Legal Compliance Trust Governance \u00b6 The following is a graphical and procedural depiction on how trust asserted from BBU Roles are currently received, assessed, and relied upon in the BBU. For the BBU Governance Framework: The Bedrock Board of Directors has established the BBU Governance Framework and this BBU Trust Assurance Framework. It has created its own Policies and those it requires of Stewards in their Role within the BBU. The Bedrock Board of Directors requires members to sign the contractual instruments and perform Self-Certification that the member is compliant with the Bedrock Member Business Policies and Bedrock Member Technical Policies . This Self-Certification is reviewed by the responsible Bedrock Governing Body and reported to the Bedrock Board of Directors prior to approval of the Steward. Trust Assurance Matrix \u00b6 The BBU Trust AssuranceMatrix is a tabbed spreadsheet which correlates existing Bedrock Governance Framework Policy statements across BBU Governance Framework documents and relevant stakeholders. This matrix is the foundation of self and third-party audits needed to verify compliance to the Sovrin Governance Framework. \u00a9 2020 by Bedrock Consortium.

Nominees recommended by the nominating committee may volunteer for the newly staggered terms for the first election. If the staggered terms are not evenly distributed, then the Executive Committee will assign Trustees to terms to make them evenly staggered. Newly added members of the Board of Directors shall serve until the next regularly scheduled election unless the resulting term would be less than six months in which case they would serve until the second regularly scheduled election and then if eligible for an additional term, that term will be set by the Executive Committee to correspond to the already staggered terms of the Board of Directors as to ensure an even amount of staggered terms going forward. Nominations. Prior to the completion of the initial Trustees term and annually thereafter, the Board shall select a nominations committee to present a list to the Board of Trustees containing names of eligible nominees as Trustees for the ensuing year. Said list shall contain the names of at least one eligible nominee to each vacancy. In case the Board of Trustees fails, for any reason, to elect such a committee within the time specified, then it shall be the duty of the Chair to appoint such a committee. Nominations made by the committee for the Trustees must be delivered to the Secretary at least thirty (30) days before the completion of the initial Trustees term and annually thereafter.

Regular and Annual Meetings \u00b6 An annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held at a time and day in the month of March of each calendar year and at a location designated by the Board. The Board of Directors may provide by resolution the time and place, for the holding of regular meetings of the Board. Notice of the annual meeting, and notice of the first regular meeting under a Board resolution, shall be sent in writing or electronically to all members of the Board of Directors no fewer than ten (10) days prior to the meeting date, subject to waiver of notice as provided in the Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act. Section 4. Special Meetings \u00b6 Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairperson or any two members of the Board of Directors. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any location as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board called by them but must give the other Trustees notice at least two (2) days in advance of the meeting by telephone, electronically, or in writing, subject to waiver of notice as provided in the Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act. The meeting notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting. Section 5. Participation in Meetings \u00b6 Any Trustee may participate in an annual, regular, or special meeting of the Board of Directors, or conduct such a meeting, through the use of any means of communication by which all participating Trustees may hear each other during the meeting or, in the case of hearing impaired persons, read the other Trustees\u2019 remarks during the meeting. Trustees participating by such means shall be counted as \u201cpresent\u201d for quorum purposes and may participate in discussion and voting. Section 6. Action without Meeting \u00b6 Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, provided there is written notice (which may be electronic) to all Trustees at least two (2) days in advance and no Trustee objects within the notice period to the action being taken without a meeting. The proposed action is approved only if it receives the requisite number of affirmative votes in writing (which may be electronic) under the applicable quorum and voting requirements herein. Section 7. Quorum \u00b6 The presence of a simple majority of current members of the Board of Directors shall be necessary at any meeting to constitute a quorum to transact business, but a lesser number shall have power to adjourn to a specified later date without notice. The act of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by law or by these Bylaws.

General Security Policies \u00b6 Transaction Endorser MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral to maintain protection of all services provided in association with the Transaction Endorser Agreement (\u201cEndorser Services\u201d). These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees of the Endorser involved with providing the Endorser Services. The Transaction Endorser shall designate its CIO or another officer to provide executive oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision management, employee education, and compliance enforcement. Transaction Endorser MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such policies as the Endorser deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Endorser Services. Transaction Endorser MUST maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment verification requirements for all new hires involved with providing its Endorser Services and will extend such requirements to wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing its Endorser Services. In accordance with the Transaction Endorser\u2019s internal process and procedures, these requirements MUST be periodically reviewed and MUST include, but may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and additional checks as deemed necessary by the Transaction Endorser. Each Transaction Endorser company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring process as applicable and permitted under local law. Employees of a Transaction Endorser involved with its Endorser Services MUST complete security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will comply with the Transaction Endorser\u2019s ethical business conduct, confidentiality, security, privacy, and data protection policies. Additional policy and process training MUST be provided to persons granted administrative access to components that are specific to their role within the Transaction Endorser\u2019s operation and support of its Endorser Services. If a Transaction Endorser performs its Endorser Services in its own data center, the Transaction Endorser\u2019s security policies MUST also adequately address physical security and entry control according to industry best practices. If a Transaction Endorser performs its Endorser Services using a third-party Hosting Provider, the Transaction Endorser MUST ensure that the security, privacy, and data protection policies of the Hosting Provider meet the requirements in this document. Transaction Endorser MUST make available to the Bedrock Consortium upon request evidence of stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations held by the Transaction Endorser, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry standards. 2. Security Incident Policies \u00b6 Transaction Endorser MUST maintain and follow documented incident response policies consistent with NIST guidelines for computer security incident handling and will comply with data breach notification terms of the Transaction Endorser Agreement. Transaction Endorser MUST investigate unauthorized access of which the Transaction Endorser becomes aware (security incident), and the Transaction Endorser will define and execute an appropriate response plan. The Bedrock Consortium may notify the Transaction Endorser of a suspected vulnerability or incident by submitting a technical support request. Transaction Endorser MUST notify the Bedrock Consortium without undue delay upon confirmation of a security incident that is known or reasonably suspected by the Transaction Endorser to affect the Consortium. The Transaction Endorser will provide the Bedrock Consortium with the reasonably requested information about such security incident and the status of any of the Transaction Endorser remediation and restoration activities. 3.

Document Name Bedrock Consortium Ledger Access Policies Version v0.9 Approval Date Status Pre-Launch Phase: Governance Framework Development Governs Policies for reading and writing to the Bedrock Business Utility Governed By Bedrock Governance Framework Workgroup 1. DECLARATION OF INTENT \u00b6 The Bedrock Business Utility ( \"Bedrock Ledger' ) will operate with limited write access as specified by the Permissioned Write Access processing section declared herein. The scope of these policies pertains to the full corpus of Bedrock Ledger Environments , namely all the ledgers associated with the Bedrock Ledger (i.e.: prod, test, dev). 2. RECOMMENDED READING \u00b6 The terms used in this Controlled Document are more fully explained in the Glossary , as well as in the Legal Architecture Overview which includes a visual diagram. One topic pertinent to ledger access is the concept of a Tombstone . A Steward MAY, for regulatory or individual business requirements, determine that it needs to forbid access to a ledger entry and therefore require the ability to mark the subject entry as \"deleted\". While the Bedrock Consortium has taken action to minimize such risk by prohibiting public write access, a Tombstone provides an added protection mechanism that will help mitigate risk for Stewards who are contractually obligated to carry out read and write transactions. As a trusted utility within the Sovrin Network, the Bedrock Ledger will allow for Tombstones once this feature is implemented in Hyperledger Indy . The Bedrock Consortium will collaborate with the Sovrin Technical Governance Board to allow a Steward to: Mark a Transaction as \"deleted\" thereby suggesting it should no longer be returned in response to requests for read access. Declare a Transaction as \"deleted\" under one of two categories: Node-Specific Tombstone or a Ledger-Wide Tombstone . Tombstones do not modify data on the ledger. Instead they impact the behavior of a Steward Node that serves data from the ledger. In the general, a Tombstone MAY be used by a Steward that is forced to comply with a legal demand to stop returning a specific Transaction, such as a Transaction containing data that is locally considered Personal Data or that is illegal or violates the Transaction Author Agreement in some other way. In such a case, other Stewards may not face the same legal demands and may take different action. 1. Transaction Author Agreement \u00b6 The Bedrock Consortium MUST: Publish a Transaction Author Agreement between a Transaction Author and the Bedrock Consortium (representing the Bedrock Business Utility as a whole) specifying the terms and conditions under which Transaction Authors agree to submit write Transactions to the Bedrock Ledger, including the policies defined in this Controlled Document. Publish a Steward Data Processing Agreement (DPA) specifying the requirements for a Steward to serve as a Data Processor on behalf of Transaction Authors as Data Controllers and the Bedrock Consortium as a Designated Data Controller. When necessary, revise the Transaction Author Agreement and the Steward DPA under the same policies as a Controlled Document as specified in the Governance section of the Bedrock Governance Framework Master Document. Maintain a published version of the Transaction Author Agreement and the Steward DPA in the Bedrock Consortium Code Repository . A Transaction Author MUST agree not to submit Transactions that contain: Data that would violate the intellectual property rights of others. Data that may not lawfully be written to the Bedrock Ledger, where the definition of applicable law in this context is provided in the Transaction Author Agreement. A Transaction Author MUST agree not to submit a Transaction that contains Personal Data. A Transaction Author MUST agree that if it is determined in a court of law that one or more Transactions made by the Transaction Author violated the terms and conditions of the Transaction Author Agreement, the Transaction Author consents to the marking of those Transactions with a Tombstone and, if possible, the revocation of the State Proof(s) pertaining to the Bedrock Ledger data for those Transactions. 2. Transaction Endorser Agreement \u00b6 The Bedrock Consortium MUST: Publish a Transaction Endorser Agreement between the Transaction Endorser and the Bedrock Consortium specifying the terms and conditions under which Transaction Endorsers agree to write Transactions to the Bedrock Ledger, including the policies defined in this Controlled Document. Publish a Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement (DPA) specifying the requirements for a Transaction Endorser to serve as a Data Processor on behalf of Transaction Authors as Data Controllers and the Bedrock Consortium as a Designated Data Controller. When necessary, revise the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser DPA under the same policies as a Controlled Document as specified in the Governance section of the Bedrock Governance Framework Master Document. Publish the current version of the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser DPA in the Bedrock Consortium Code Repository . A Transaction Endorser MUST adhere to membership entitlements that constrain the number of transactions that may be submitted as specified in the Transaction Endorser Agreement. A Transaction Endorser MUST: Only submit Transactions from Transaction Authors who have explicitly agreed to the Transaction Author Agreement by physically signing a copy. Maintain physical or digital evidence of conformance to this policy. 3. Permissioned Write Access \u00b6 The scope of the policies defined in this section is defined as follows: The policies in this section MUST apply to all Bedrock Ledger Environments. The policies governing write access to non-production Bedrock Ledger Environments (i.e.: Dev, Test) MAY be defined separately by other Controlled Documents. Bedrock Consortium Trustees are permitted to write Transactions to the Bedrock Ledger under the following rules: This policy MUST apply only to Trustees acting in their role as Trustees of the Bedrock Consortium. A Trustee MUST only make the following Transactions if the Transaction has been approved by a motion of the Bedrock Consortium Board of Directors. Add or remove a Trustee. Add or remove a Steward. Add or remove a Transaction Endorser. Update the Membership Management System. A Trustee MAY make Bedrock Ledger maintenance Transactions if the Transaction is approved by either the Bedrock Consortium Board of Directors. Bedrock Consortium members who are permitted to serve in the role of Transaction Endorsers MUST agree to the Transaction Endorser Agreement by submitting a physically or digitally signed copy to the Bedrock Consortium. Transaction Authors are permitted to write Transactions to the Bedrock Ledger provided:: Each Transaction includes a valid digital signature from the Transaction Author. The Transaction is endorsed by an approved Transaction Endorser. If the Transaction updates the state of a ledger-persisted data structure, it MUST be digitally signed by the same Transaction Author that recorded the previous state. 4. Public Write Access \u00b6 Public Write Access is PROHIBITED. All Bedrock Ledger Environments MUST adhere to Permissioned Write Access processing. 5. Public Read Access \u00b6 The Bedrock Ledger MUST be publicly available for anyone to submit read transactions. Stewards MUST provide public read access without cost for all Transactions on the Bedrock Ledger unless marked by a Tombstone. Once Tombstone functionality has been: implemented by the underlying ledger technology, approved by the Sovrin Technical Governance Board, and approved by the Bedrock Consortium Board of Directors, a Steward MAY mark a Transaction as a Node-Specific Tombstone if: Requested by the Transaction Author of a Transaction for a valid reason as specified by the Transaction Author Agreement. Required of the Steward by a court order. The Steward has evidence that the Transaction violates the terms and conditions of the Transaction Author Agreement.

Document Name Member Business Policies Version v0.9 Approval Date Status Pre-Launch Phase: Governance Framework Development Governs Steward Qualification, Application, Activation, Operation, Notification, Suspension, Termination, and Transition Governed By Bedrock Governance Framework Work Group 1. Member Qualification \u00b6 A Member MUST be a business organization registered to conduct business in at least one recognized Jurisdiction. A Member MUST comply with the laws and regulations of the Jurisdiction(s) of which the Member is part or in which the Member is legally licensed to operate or registered to conduct business. A Member MUST attest and provide supporting evidence to the Bedrock Consortiumn in the application or requalification process that the Member is: Financially solvent. Not undergoing any criminal proceedings. A Member MUST belong to one of the following categories: A governmental body or agency, or an entity predominantly owned and controlled by the state, in a Jurisdiction as defined in the Sovrin Glossary. One of the following types of governmentally regulated institutions with at least five (5) years operating history: Financial institution Healthcare provider Insurance company A law firm, accounting firm, or other legally-regulated institution with at least five (5) years operating history. A non-governmental organization (NGO) or Social Purpose Organization with at least five (5) years operating history. An accredited university or other institution of higher education with at least five (5) years operating history. A certificate authority (CA) with at least five (5) years operating history. An Organization that does not qualify under one of the above categories but meets all of the following conditions: Submits an application with written evidence satisfactory to the Bedrock Consortium that it meets all the other requirements in this section and is fully capable of complying with all the requirements of Bedrock Consortium Governance Framework. Includes in its application a written statement explaining why it supports the mission of the Bedrock Consortium and why it should be selected by the Consortium Board of Trustees as a Member. Agrees, contingent on its approval as a Member, to publish and maintain that written statement as a public document linkable on the Web. Receives approval to be a Member from the Bedrock Consortium Board of Trustees. 2. Application \u00b6 The Bedrock Consortium Member application and selection process MUST: Use the Core Principles of the Governance Framework as a guide, with special attention to the Decentralization by Design principles. Be publicly documented on the Bedrock Consortium website. To apply, an Organization MUST submit a written application to the Bedrock Consortium Governing Body responsible for Member applications as directed on the Bedrock Consortium website. The Member application process MUST follow the guidelines for Self-Certification, Certification, or Accreditation as specified by the Bedrock Consortium Trust Assurance Framework. In evaluating and prioritizing Member applications, the Bedrock Consortium MUST take into account: a. Public contributions of any kind, including but not limited to open source engineering resources, efforts to drive Bedrock Consortium adoption, participation in Bedrock Consortium governance, marketing efforts, and direct financial contributions, that the prospective Member has made in the past to the Bedrock Consortium or the Sovrin Community. b. Public contributions of any kind the prospective Member commits (in writing in its Member application) to making to the Bedrock Consortium or the Sovrin Community. Any other specific Practices and Procedures involved in the Member application process MUST be publicly documented on the Bedrock Consortium website. 3. Activation \u00b6 Before a Member may qualify to have an active Validator Node on the Bedrock Consortium Ledger, the Member MUST: Have their application approved by the responsible Bedrock Consortium Governing Body. Submit an executed copy of the Bedrock Consortium Member Agreement and receive a countersigned copy from the Bedrock Consortium. Pass any required tests on the Bedrock Consortium Test Network as specified by the Technical Governance Board and documented in the Bedrock Consortium Code Repository. After a Member has qualified to have an active Validator Node, the Member MUST designate the Bedrock Consortium Ledger network(s) (e.g., Bedrock Consortium Main Network, Bedrock Consortium Staging Network, Bedrock Consortium Builder Network, Bedrock Consortium Permissioned Test Network, etc.) in which their Node may be activated. The Member MUST make this designation following the procedures specified by the Technical Governance Board. The Member MUST designate activation in at least one Bedrock Consortium Ledger network. The Member MAY designate activation in more than one Bedrock Consortium Ledger network. If the Member designates its Node to be activated ONLY on the Permissioned Test Network, the Member MUST receive approval from the Bedrock Consortium Board of Trustees. Such approval MAY have a time limit or other requirements as determined by the Bedrock Consortium Board of Trustees. The Member MAY change their designation but not more often than once every 90 days. After a Member has made the designation in 3.2, but on or before the day on which the Validator Node is activated on any Bedrock Consortium Ledger network: The Bedrock Consortium MUST list the Member's Public Profile information on the Bedrock Consortium website. The Member MUST make a public announcement approved by the Bedrock Consortium that their Organization has been approved as a Bedrock Consortium Steward. Although a Member may make an announcement about being approved as a Bedrock Consortium Member anytime after completing step 3.1.2, a Member MUST NOT make any public announcement of their Node being live on the Bedrock Consortium Network prior to the day their Node is activated on at least one Bedrock Consortium Ledger network. A Member whose application has been approved by the Bedrock Consortium but whose Node does not qualify to be an active Validator Node within six months of the date of approval MUST requalify and be reapproved by the Bedrock Consortium prior to activation. 4. Operation \u00b6 A Member MUST operate its Node in compliance with the Member Technical and Organizational Policies. A Member MUST requalify at least annually via the requalification process in effect at that point in time as specified by the responsible Bedrock Consortium Governing Body and documented on the Bedrock Consortium website. 5. Notification \u00b6 A Member MUST maintain current contact information for its business and technical points of contacts sufficient to ensure its staff are reachable in a timely manner. A Member MUST notify the responsible Bedrock Consortium Governing Body if: There is a change to the beneficial ownership of its Organization. There is a change to the Member's legal name, trademark, or logo. The Member changes the values of any of the Member's attributes submitted in the Member's original application, including legal jurisdiction, legal status, Node location, Node hosting type, or Node technical specifications, that are material to the Node Selection Algorithm. There is any other substantial change to its Organization that impacts the qualification criteria in the Member Qualification section. It suffers a data breach or other public event which may reasonably call into question its ability to comply with the Governance Framework. In the case of any of the changes listed in #2 above, the responsible Bedrock Consortium Governing Body MAY require the Member to requalify. The Bedrock Consortiumn MUST provide Members with at least 30 days notification of any material changes to the business policies implemented in Bedrock Consortium Network environments. Notification about technical changes is covered under Bedrock Consortium Member Technical and Organizational Policies . 6. Suspension \u00b6 A Member MUST be suspended by the responsible Bedrock Consortium Governing Body under any of the following conditions: The Member no longer complies with the Member Business Policies, Member Technical and Organizational Policies, or any other requirements of the Bedrock Consortium Governance Framework. The Member's Node has failed to achieve 98% availability over a period of 30 days. A security intrusion or violation has been reported and the Technical Governance Board is not satisfied that the Member has performed adequate remediation.

Ledger Software Policies \u00b6 The Bedrock Board of Directors MUST decide the software technology and version used by all Nodes (Validator, Observer). This software is referred to as the Bedrock Open Source Code. The Bedrock Board of Directors MAY leverage the Sovrin Technical Governance Board (TGB) or another 3rd party service to maintain a version of the Bedrock Open Source Code. 2. General Security Policies \u00b6 A Member (Founding Steward/Steward/Subscriber) MUST maintain and follow IT security policies and practices that are integral to maintaining protection of all services provided in association with the Bedrock Consortium Member Agreement (\u201cMember Services\u201d). These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees of the Member involved with providing the Member Services. The Member shall designate its CIO or another officer to provide executive oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision management, employee education, and compliance enforcement. A Member MUST review its IT security policies at least annually and amend such policies as the Member deems reasonable to maintain protection of its Member Services. Because Node administrators are a potential threat vector, a Member MUST maintain and follow its standard mandatory employment verification requirements for all new hires involved with providing its Member Services and will extend such requirements to wholly-owned subsidiaries involved with providing its Member Services. In accordance with the Member's internal process and procedures, these requirements MUST be periodically reviewed and include, but may not be limited to, criminal background checks, proof of identity validation, and additional checks as deemed necessary by the Member. Each Member company is responsible for implementing these requirements in its hiring process as applicable and permitted under local law. Employees of a Member involved with providing its Member Services MUST complete security and privacy education annually and certify each year that they will comply with the Member's ethical business conduct, confidentiality, security, privacy, and data protection policies. Additional policy and process training MUST be provided to persons granted administrative access to components that are specific to their role within the Member's operation and support of its Member Services. If a Member hosts its Node in its own data center, the Member's security policies MUST also adequately address physical security and entry control according to industry best practices. If the Member hosts its Node using a third-party Hosting Provider, the Member MUST ensure that the security, privacy, and data protection policies of the Hosting Provider meet the requirements in this document. A Member MUST make available to the Bedrock Consortium upon request evidence of stated compliance with these policies and any relevant accreditations held by the Member, including certificates, attestations, or reports resulting from accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, SSAE SOC 2, or other industry standards. 3. General Node Policies \u00b6 A Member Node: MUST be available to run as a Validator Node or Observer Node on any of the formal ledgers associated with the Bedrock Ledger Environments. MUST run a release of the Bedrock Open Source Code that has been approved and designated by the Bedrock Board of Directors and Sovrin Technical Governance Board (TGB). MUST facilitate an upgrade to a new version of the Bedrock Open Source Code within three (3) business days of a new release that has been: recommended by the TGB, and accepted by the Bedrock Consortium. MUST register all Node configuration data required by the Pool Ledger in a timely manner, keeping information up to date within three (3) business days of changes. MUST have at least two (2) IT-qualified persons assigned to administer the node, and at least one other person that has adequate access and training to administer the Node in an emergency, such as the network being unable to reach consensus or being under attack. See the TGB regarding specific Crisis Management Plan details. MUST supply contact info for all administrators to the Bedrock Consortium, whose accuracy is tested at least quarterly (e.g., by sending an email and/or text that doesn\u2019t bounce). MUST maintain a system backup or snapshot or image such that recovering the system from failure could be expected to take one hour or less. 4. Node Technical Policies \u00b6 For all ledgers within the Bedrock Ledger Environments list, the following requirements apply to Nodes on the prod instance of the BBU. These requirements may be downgraded from MUST to SHOULD for any Nodes on ledgers that are for non-production purposes. MUST run on robust server-class hardware. If a Node is run on a VM, the Member: MUST run on a mainstream hypervisor that receives timely patches from its vendor or community. SHOULD apply hypervisor patches on a regular basis. The Node MUST run in an OS that is dedicated to the validator, i.e., a single-purpose (physical or virtual) machine that MUST run Bedrock Open Source Code, MAY run other software approved by the TGB, and MUST NOT run any other software. Software required to support the node, such as monitoring, backup, and configuration management software, are approved as a general category. However, Members should discuss with the TGB any software packages that transmit between the Member Node and the outside. MUST run a server with compatible versions of the operating systems supported by the Hyperledger Indy Node requirements as documented in the release notes. MUST have adequate compute power (in late 2019, 8 or more cores is considered adequate). MUST have adequate RAM (in late 2019, 32 GB of RAM is considered adequate). MUST have at least 1 TB, with the ability to grow to 2 TB, of reliable (e.g., RAIDed) disk space, with an adequately sized boot partition. MUST have a high-speed connection to the internet with highly available, redundant pipes (as of late 2019, 100 Mbps was considered adequate). MUST have at least one dedicated NIC for BBU Validator Node consensus traffic, and a different NIC to process external requests. Each NIC must have a stable, static, world-routable IP address. MUST be implemented in a way that does not endanger Bedrock's high availability architecture, which is pool-based rather than node-based. Nodes should not take more responsibility for high availability than what is contemplated by the Node Selection Algorithm. For example, they should listen at exactly one pair of network addresses (see 3.9 above), using exactly one set of keys to respond to BBU/Indy protocol traffic at any one time, and adhere to a minimal failover recovery delay period specified by the Bedrock Consortium (or 30 seconds if not specified). MUST have a system clock that is demonstrably in sync with well-known NTP servers. SHOULD have a power supply consistent with high availability systems. 5. Node Security Policies \u00b6 A Member: MUST maintain Member keys on a separate machine from the machine that runs their node. This machine, called the \u201cCLI (Command Line Interface) system\u201d, uses Member keys to authorize the Node to participate in the pool, and is thus the basis for trust for the node and the Member's identity on the network. The CLI system is not required to have high-end hardware, but in terms of IT best practices for security , it must meet or exceed the standards for the Node (see following items). MUST provide certification that their Node runs in a locked datacenter with appropriate levels of security, including the specifications that they target (e.g., SSAE 16 type II compliance; other standards may also be acceptable). MUST assert that their Node is isolated from internal systems of a Member (because the Validator Node is publicly visible and thus an inappropriate candidate for access to privileged internal networks). MUST assert that their Node, and its underlying systems, uses state-of-the-art authentication for remote access (at least SSH with key plus password plus source IP firewall rule, and two-factor authentication wherever possible). MUST NOT allow access (remote or local) to the Node or CLI systems by anyone other than assigned admins. MUST apply the latest security patches within one (1) week or less (24 hours or less is recommended). MUST attest that the Node runs on a server protected by a firewall that, at minimum: Disallows public ingress except on ports used by the Node software (different machines may choose to expose ledger features on different ports, so no standard port setup is required). Optionally enables SSH, Remote Desktop, and similar remote access tools but constrains ingress for these tools in some way that excludes the public but allows access for admins. Locks down egress ports to limit the ability to jump from Node to some other location. MUST run the Member security check tool as requested, and MUST receive TGB approval of the results before the Node is authorized to participate in consensus. MUST run the Member security check tool from time to time as requested by the TGB and provide the test results report to the TGB within three (3) business days. 6. Node Operating Policies \u00b6 A Member: MUST equip at least two (2) technical points of contact responsible for administering the Member Node with an SMS-capable device for alerting. SHOULD aim to achieve at least 99.9% (three nines) uptime for their Node (this amounts to about 1.4 minutes of downtime per day or 9 hours per year). SHOULD coordinate downtime with other Members in advance via a mechanism as determined from time to time by agreement between the TGB and any other relevant Bedrock Consortium Governing Body. 7. Node Selection Algorithm \u00b6 The TGB will take direction from the Bedrock Consortium Board of Directors, or a designated Bedrock Workgroup, regarding the configuration parameters associated with the deployment of the Node Selection Algorithm. The selection of active Validator Nodes at any point in time, at least on the BBU, MUST be governed by the Node Selection Algorithm. Non-technical inputs or policy decisions implemented by the Node Selection Algorithm MUST be approved by the Bedrock Consortium Board of Directors. At any point in time, the Node Selection Algorithm MUST represent the TGB\u2019s best efforts at designing an algorithm that applies the Core Principles of the Bedrock Consortium Governance Framework. Recognizing the inherent tension and tradeoffs between some of the Core Principles, the design of this algorithm should give priority to balancing: The Decentralization by Design principles, in particular the principles of Diffuse Trust and High Availability. The Security by Design principles, in particular the principles of System Diversity and Secure Failure. A human-readable, understandable, and explainable description of the current design of the algorithm as approved by the TGB MUST be published by the TGB in the official Sovrin Foundation Code Repository and made visible to all Members via a web page on the Bedrock Consortium website. 8. Reporting Policies \u00b6 A Member MUST report to the responsible Bedrock Consortium Governing Body any substantive change to the configuration or location of a Node within five (5) business days of the change.","title":"Member Technical and Organizational Policies"},{"location":"gf_controlled/member_top/#member-technical-and-organizational-policies","text":"This is a Controlled Document of the Bedrock Governance Framework was approved by the Bedrock Consortium Board of Directors.

Acknowledgements \u00b6 \u200bThis document was produced on behalf of the Board of Directors by the Governance Framework Working Group. Introduction \u00b6 The Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) serves as the constitution for the Bedrock Business Utility . The BGF (also referred to as \"BBU-GF\") is a specialized Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks (DSGFs) as described in the Sovrin ToIP Metasystem Governance Framework (STM-GF) Master Document . The BGF leverages the principles, policies, terminology, and standards defined in the STM-GF to enable trusted digital commerce based on decentralized identity. A key objective of the BGF is to address any concerns or risks that Consortium members may have with participation compliance with Data Protection Regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). The BGF formally consists of a set of interrelated documents that collectively forms the governance model for the Consortium and the DID Ledger ( did:sov:biz ) that the Consortium manages. The documents are organized in three (3) categories; Blue = Normative, Yellow = Assessment, White = Informative. Category Name Description Primary (White) Bedrock GF Whitepaper Introduction to the Bedrock Governance Framework V2 Primary (Blue) Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) Master Document The \u201cconstitution\u201d of the Consortium, this document defines the purpose, core principles, and core policies, and also references all other documents in the GF. Primary (Blue) Bedrock Glossary A comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout all the GF documents Primary (Yellow) Bedrock Trust Assurance Framework This document defines criteria and processes for assessing conformance of different consortium stakeholder to the policies of the Bedrock Governance Framework. Legal (Blue) Bedrock Founding Member Agreement Contractual instrument between the Consortium and a Founding Member. Legal (Blue) Bedrock Steward Member Agreement Contractual instrument between the Consortium and a Steward Member. Legal (Blue) Trust Anchor Agreement Contractual instrument between the Consortium and any person or organization initiating a write transaction to the Identity Utility Ledger. Controlled Documents (Blue) Governing Body Policies The governance policies that apply to all Bedrock Governing Bodies. Controlled Documents (Blue) Ledger Access Policies Governing policies for reading and writing to all Bedrock Ledgers and the processing of BBU transactional data. Controlled Documents (Blue) Member Business Policies Governing qualification, application, activation, operation, suspension, and termination of Founding Members. Controlled Documents (Blue) Member Technical Policies Governing the security, node operation, node selection, and reporting requirements for Founding Members. Controlled Documents (Blue) Economic Policies Governing economic incentives, fees, and regulatory compliance and budgetary management. Controlled Documents (Blue) Bedrock Certification Mark Policies Governing the establishment of and use of the Bedrock Certification policies for ecosystem stakeholders. Purpose \u00b6 The purpose of the Bedrock Business Utility is to provide a decentralized global public utility for trusted commerce. It is one of many possible DID Ledgers (\"Peer-Nets\"). The purpose of the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) is to define the business, legal, and technical policies for the Bedrock Business Utility. The purpose of the Bedrock Consortium is to administer decentralized governance for Bedrock Business Utility. Core Principles \u00b6 Unless otherwise noted, the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) is aligned with the principles outlined in the STM-GF Master Document . Core Polices \u00b6 In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design and Security by Design principles: Policies, practices, procedures, and algorithms governing participation of Stewards and operation of Nodes MUST follow all Core Principles. The Consortium MUST publish the following Controlled Documents managed as specified by Bedrock Governing Bodies:\u200b a. Member Business Policies b. Member Technical Policies\u200b c. Ledger Access Policies \u200b Guardianship \u00b6 In keeping with the Guardianship principle, a Guardian SHOULD: Act in the Dependent person\u2019s best interest. Exercise good judgment and carefully manage responsibilities. Avoid commingling\u2014keep Dependent\u2019s property separate (e.g., separate DIDs, Public Keys, Wallets, Vaults, etc.). Keep detailed records of all actions taken on behalf of the Dependent. Not violate the Anti-Impersonation principle (section 2.11.5). Be subject to applicable legal structures regarding the granting and revocation of Guardianships. \u200b Inclusion \u00b6 In keeping with the Inclusive by Design principles but in recognition of the permissioned write structure of the Bedrock Business Utility: Read access to the Bedrock Business Utility MUST be open to all types of entities. Write access will be limited to members in good standing within the consortium. Trust Assurance \u00b6 In keeping with all Core Principles and especially the Decentralization by Design principles: The Consortium MUST specify policies, practices, and procedures for assessing conformance to the Bedrock Governance Framework by publishing and maintaining the Bedrock Trust Assurance Framework\u200b \u200bas a Controlled Document managed as specified by Sovrin Governing Bodies\u200b. The Controlled Documents may leverage the services and guidance of the Sovrin Trust Assurance Framework\u200b. The Bedrock Consortium MUST publish the Bedrock Trust Mark Policies\u200b \u200bas a Controlled Document managed as specified by Bedrock Governing Bodies.\u200b The Consortium may decide to leverage instead the Trust Mark Policies but a Bedrock Controlled Document must specify such a decision/policy. An Entity serving in one of the Sovrin Network who meets the requirements in the Bedrock Trust Assurance Framework MAY use the appropriate Bedrock Trust Mark as specified in Bedrock Trust Mark Policies\u200b. Economics \u00b6 In keeping with the Sustainability principle: The Consortium MUST publish the \u200bBedrock Economic Policies\u200b \u200bas a Controlled Document managed as specified by Bedrock Governing Bodies\u200b in conjunction with Consortium legal counsel. The Consortium MUST manage Ledger Fees and any mechanism used for paying them to ensure economic viability and sustainability for the Consortium to keep with its charter as a non-profit public trust organization. The Consortium MUST retain a qualified Auditor to publish an annual public audit of Consortium finances. Governance \u00b6 The Bedrock Governance Framework Master Document and the Controlled Documents listed in Appendix A shall be revised from time to time. The policies in this section govern this process. Unless otherwise noted, the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) will adhere to the same procedures for managing document lifecycles as outlined in Section 4 of the STM-GF Master Document . All Bedrock Governance Framework documents will reside in a Github source control repository and will use the associated Issue Tracker for change management. Appendix A: Controlled Documents \u00b6 The following Controlled Documents are normative components of the Bedrock Governance Framework V1. All framework documents are published by the Consortium in two forms: A static PDF document representing the current approved version. A link is always available via the \u200bGithub repo and the table below. A sub-section of the Sovrin website so that all documentation is easily navigated. Issues / Comments \u00b6 A Github source control repository and will use the repo's Issue Tracker for change management.

Over several years, it has become an industry brand associated with decentralized identity. It represents more than an instance of a decentralized identity network based on a DLT, it is a trusted community of like-minded people and institutions from a variety of geographic regions and industry sectors. The Sovrin Community aspires to help all the entities (citizens, governments, businesses, devices) of the world to fix identity for both online and physical interactions. During this same period, we have seen a global spotlight on privacy protection that has spawned regulation, such as GDPR and CCPA, which complements the spirit of the decentralized identity movement. However, these regulations also place additional financial risk and compliance constraints on businesses that desire to participate in and contribute to this privacy protection movement. At the same time, the grassroots energy focused on \u201cidentity for all\u201d has shifted or accelerated the thinking within the Sovrin Community towards a public permission-less utility that leverages a utility token. These philosophical changes, while socially acceptable, create a number of risk mitigation dilemmas for participating institutions. As a result, some businesses have exited the community while others have been hesitant to join. Meanwhile, the hype around decentralized identity has also spawned new federated identity systems like the Global Association for Digital Identity (GADI) from the DID Alliance that promote marketing messages under the banner of decentralized identity while actually establishing architectures that contradict the core Privacy by Design Principles. GADI architecture enables a collection of Digital Address Providers (DAPs) to centrally manage identities for individuals whereas the Sovrin Community advocates for an architecture that allows identities to be managed without reliance on any external administrative authority. The Sovrin Community is comprised of minimally two disparate market segments. Both segments can agree on an Open by Design governance approach. While the members within each market segment may require incompatible governance models, both segments adamantly disagree with any deviation from an open approach at the technology or governance levels. To counter the pendulum bob swinging so far to the left, we have witnessed proposals for alternative proprietary solutions that reflect an unacceptable swing of the bob to the right. This oscillation between extremes depicts an opportunity to steer the pendulum bob to a center position that would allow institutions to strike a balance between open privacy by design and financial risks. Transition \u00b6 As the Sovrin Foundation transitions to the Sovrin ToIP Metasystem Governance Framework (STM-GF) , flexibility now exists for the establishment of one or more Identity Utility Networks that can serve the needs of the diverse segments of the Sovrin Community. The Bedrock Business Utility is intended to address three key concerns: Policy Gridlock Permissioned Safe Zone Token-free Economics Policy Gridlock \u00b6 The Sovrin approach for decentralized identity is to tackle it at global scale. The Sovrin Community, much like the global societies it seeks to represent, struggles with the formation of policies that can be embraced all at once by its members. The balancing of diversity goals at the operational level, risk mitigation for privacy regulation compliance, identity access for all, and the sustainability of a stable and reliable network is a non-trivial exercise. The technology adoption lifecycle teaches us that we cannot assume that all interested stakeholders will be able to embrace and adopt the technology at the same rate. The Sovrin Foundation must find ways for it to [a] stay true to its vision; [b] aid all stakeholders on their decentralized identity journey; and [c] remain financially sustainable.\u2028Businesses and Governments around the world must be able to balance risk mitigation and technology adoption if Sovrin desires to be an open community for all. Additionally, all stakeholders must accept the fact that a single network (DID ledger) cannot serve the entire globe. As an example, the Sovrin Network uses Hyperledger Indy, which like many consensus algorithms, carries an expected threshold of optimal validator nodes, thereby limiting the scalability of a single network. The decentralized identity community cannot afford to have disputes at the network level. We should be focused on market creation not market bifurcation. We live in a heterogeneous world of networks where interoperability is paramount.\u2028A single network cannot meet the needs of everyone and continued attempts to do so will minimally yield increased complexity and confusion. In fact, we have seen this within the Sovrin Foundation as it has been difficult to obtain closure after nearly a year on Version 2 of the Sovrin Governance Framework. The fact is that the Sovrin Foundation has been in gridlock due to apprehension between policy decisions that may be necessary for one market segment and uncomfortable for another. This concern impacts the business market segment as well as external coalitions such as FINDY and KIVA who may desire to have their own governance framework while participating in the Sovrin Community. One approach to breaking the gridlock while still enabling two market segments to co-exist is to establish a community bound to a common vision but comprised of safe-spaces for each segment to establish their own governance. Permissioned Safe Zone \u00b6 Preventive measures for avoiding the possible insertion of personal data into an immutable ledger has been the focus of much discussion. While many have agreed that a 100% guarantee is not possible, the implementation of a public write model only increases such exposure thereby making interested stakeholders more apprehensive to embrace a permission-less governance model. A diligent effort has been made within the Sovrin Foundation to address the GDPR risks associated community stakeholders. In collaboration with legal experts, the community has established a series of contractual instruments that address these risks for each stakeholder under both the public-write and permissioned write models. Unfortunately, this effort has resulted in a greater degree of complexity to the governance framework. It has also yielded an increase in costs for Stewards that need to comply with a broader set of technical and operational requirements. One approach to reducing the complexity of governance policies is to transition the existing Sovrin Network (DID Ledger) into a dedicated ledger for public write access and then add a new DID Ledger that would operate under a separate governance model for permissioned writes. Token-free Economics \u00b6 Sovrin is amidst a transition from the Sovrin Provisional Trust Framework to a new Sovrin Governance Framework that favors the use of a crypto-token to enable a payment model for public-write interactions with the ledger. The combination of public write access coupled with the conveniences of a payment token would open identity access up to a very diverse community that is currently unable to establish a trusted identity reputation. While the social benefits of such an approach are appealing to many, the ability for many enterprises and some governments to embrace tokens at this point in time is limiting. Once again, a compromise that will allow two market segments to co-exist is to establish a community bound to a common vision but comprised of safe-spaces for each segment to establish their own governance. Common Ground \u00b6 The pathway to a common vision for decentralized identity is rooted in open standards and open source communities. As a community, we agree on: an Open by Design approach avoidance of with any deviation from an open approach at the technology or governance levels the need to support a network of networks model that enables disparate market segments to deploy different governance Fundamentally, no single organization can own a network (system of ledgers) and the network must be built upon open standards and protocols where interoperability has been achieved.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"gf_info/transition/#global-growth","text":"Sovrin\u2019s entry into the decentralized identity market began as a permissioned public ledger.

The nodes of this immutable ledger are hosted by a variety of businesses around the world, called Stewards. The Ledger is intended to enable Transaction Authors (see below) to publish decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and other cryptographic data structures required for the issuance and verification of digital credentials. It is expected that the Ledger will be used primarily by businesses who have a need to issue these credentials. The credentials themselves are never written to the Ledger, so these issuers generally have no need to write data to the Ledger. This approach avoids issuers increasing risks associated with personal data under data protection regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). GDPR Position Paper \u00b6 The Sovrin Foundation in conjunction with its legal counsel Perkins Coie has published a white paper providing a detailed legal analysis of the applicability of the GDPR to the Sovrin Ledger and Sovrin Network. The Bedrock Consortium recognizes this work-product as prior art with applicability to any DID Ledger, especially those that are trusted within the Sovrin Ecosystem of Trust . The GDPR Position Paper also assesses the data protection requirements of the higher layers (the Agent-to-Agent Protocol Layer and the Credential Exchange Layer). Legal Architecture \u00b6 The following figure is a visual illustration of the key roles and agreements in the Bedrock Consortium\u2019s legal framework for regulatory compliance with data protection laws. Although it uses terms from the GDPR, it is intended for compliance with data protection regulations generally. The following sections explain the actors, roles, policies, and legal agreements depicted in this diagram. Note that formal definitions for all terms that appear in First Letter Capitals are provided in the Glossary . Actors & Roles \u00b6 Bedrock Consortium \u00b6 The Bedrock Consortium is an international subsidiary non-profit public trust organization chartered to provide governance for the Bedrock Business Utility. The Bedrock Consortium is responsible for development and maintenance of the Bedrock Governance Framework (BGF) that establishes the purpose, principles, and policies for operation of Bedrock Business Utility. Transaction Authors \u00b6 A Transaction Author is any Organization who submits a Transaction to be written to the Ledger. As explained below, under the Permissioned Write Access policies of the BGF currently in effect, only Organizations may write Transactions. Transaction Authors may write any data type supported by the Ledger \u2014 see What Goes On The Ledger? Transaction Endorsers \u00b6 A Transaction Endorser is an Organization that has been approved by the Bedrock Consortium to endorse Transactions on behalf of Transaction Authors. The role of Transaction Endorser is specified by the Permissioned Write Access policies of the BGF. Transaction Endorsers add their digital signature to a Transaction so it will be accepted and written by the Stewards. Under the BGF, Transaction Endorsers must acquire unlimited or limited write access to the Ledger. Transaction Endorsers must enter into both the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement with the Bedrock Consortium. Subscribers \u00b6 Subscribers are trusted institutions who desire to participate in the Consortium as Transaction Endorsers who procure a limited number of write transaction units on an annual basis. Subscribers must enter into the Subscribers Agreement with the Bedrock Consortium. Subscribers must enter into the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement with the Bedrock Consortium. Stewards \u00b6 Stewards are trusted institutions who operate a Node of the Ledger. Stewards must meet the qualifications specified in Member Business Policies. Stewards must enter into both the Steward Agreement and the Steward Data Processing Agreement with the Bedrock Consortium. Stewards are automatically qualified to be Transaction Endorsers, however if they wish to assume that role they must separately enter into the Transaction Endorser Agreement and the Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement with the Bedrock Consortium. Sovrin Ledger Access Policies \u00b6 Permissioned Write Access \u00b6 This is the set of policies that require Transaction Authors to obtain the endorsement of a Transaction Endorser in order to write a Transaction to the Ledger. There are two primary reasons for the Permissioned Write Access policy: It protects the Ledger by requiring Transaction Endorsers, who have a direct contractual relationship with the Bedrock Consortium to enforce the Permissioned Write Access policies, to ensure that a Transaction Author Agreement is in effect and to leverage an allocated write unit as a form of payment for a Transaction. Write Units are acquired based on Membership Type. It reduces the risk of Personal Data being written to the Ledger as that is currently prohibited under the Permissioned Write Access policies. The Bedrock Consortium feels this protection is necessary under the current regulatory uncertainty regarding Personal Data on an immutable public ledger. See the GDPR Position Paper for more details. Public Write Access \u00b6 Under Public Write Access policies, the requirement of a Transaction Endorser signing a Transaction Authors request is eliminated; anyone would be able to write to the Ledger by following a programmatic process that aims to provide the necessary assurances against privacy compliance risks. This form of access to the Ledger is prohibited under the BGF . Legal Document Architecture \u00b6 Primary Legal Agreements \u00b6 Transaction Author Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Bedrock Consortium and all Transaction Authors. It has been developed specifically to protect the right of every Transaction Author to have and hold self-sovereign identity credentials while also protecting the Ledger and the infrastructure provided by the Bedrock Consortium as a global public utility. It is intended to give effect to the data protection rights of all Transaction Authors while recognizing the technical and security requirements of a public-permissioned immutable ledger. As part of the Transaction Author Agreement, every Transaction Author also agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to the Transaction Author as a controller under the Steward Data Processing Agreement and the Transaction and the Transaction Endorser Agreement to include a Data Processing Agreement. The Ledger itself is the authoritative record of all Transaction Author Agreement signatures. Transaction Endorser Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Bedrock Consortium and all Transaction Endorsers. It is simpler than the Transaction Author Agreement because the scope is limited to enforcing the Permissioned Write Access policies, including verifying that Transaction Authors have executed the Transaction Author Agreement and paying the Ledger Fee for all endorsed Transactions. The Transaction Endorser Agreement requires that the Transaction Endorser separately execute the Transaction Endorser Data Processing Agreement and includes a current version of the Transaction Author Agreement as an Appendix. Sovrin Steward Agreement \u00b6 This is the contractual agreement between the Bedrock Consortium and all Stewards. It covers all the rights and obligations of the Bedrock Consortium and Stewards under the Bedrock Governance Framework. The Steward Agreement requires that the Steward separately execute the Steward Data Processing Agreement. Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) \u00b6 Transaction Endorser DPA \u00b6 This is the DPA required of all Transaction Endorsers acting as Data Processors for the Transaction Author as primary Data Controller and the Bedrock Consortium acting as the Designated Data Controller. It requires that the Transaction Endorser implement its own set of Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs) that must meet or exceed the Transaction Endorser Technical and Operational Policies (TOPs) specified in the Bedrock Governance Framework. Steward DPA \u00b6 This is the DPA required of Sovrin Stewards. It requires that the Steward implement its own TOMs that meets or exceeds the Steward TOPs. Technical and Operational Policies (TOPs) \u00b6 Transaction Endorser TOPs \u00b6 This is the set of policies in the Bedrock Governance Framework that establish the minimum technical and organization policies and procedures that a Transaction Endorser must implement in its own Technical and Organizational Measures (TOMs) to provide adequate security, privacy, and data protection for Transaction Authors and the Bedrock Consortium. Steward TOPs \u00b6 Similar to the Transaction Endorser TOPs, this is the set of policies in the Bedrock Governance Framework that establish the minimum technical and organization policies and procedures that a Steward must implement in its own Technical and OrganizationalMeasures (TOMs) to provide adequate security, privacy, and data protection for Transaction Authors and the Bedrock Consortium.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"gf_legal/legal_arch/#introduction","text":"The Bedrock Business Utility (\"Ledger\") is governed by the Bedrock Consortium as a dedicated public-permissioned blockchain. The nodes of this immutable ledger are hosted by a variety of businesses around the world, called Stewards. The Ledger is intended to enable Transaction Authors (see below) to publish decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and other cryptographic data structures required for the issuance and verification of digital credentials. It is expected that the Ledger will be used primarily by businesses who have a need to issue these credentials. The credentials themselves are never written to the Ledger, so these issuers generally have no need to write data to the Ledger. This approach avoids issuers increasing risks associated with personal data under data protection regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"gf_legal/legal_arch/#gdpr-position-paper","text":"The Sovrin Foundation in conjunction with its legal counsel Perkins Coie has published a white paper providing a detailed legal analysis of the applicability of the GDPR to the Sovrin Ledger and Sovrin Network.

There are two primary reasons for the Permissioned Write Access policy: It protects the Ledger by requiring Transaction Endorsers, who have a direct contractual relationship with the Bedrock Consortium to enforce the Permissioned Write Access policies, to ensure that a Transaction Author Agreement is in effect and to leverage an allocated write unit as a form of payment for a Transaction. Write Units are acquired based on Membership Type. It reduces the risk of Personal Data being written to the Ledger as that is currently prohibited under the Permissioned Write Access policies. The Bedrock Consortium feels this protection is necessary under the current regulatory uncertainty regarding Personal Data on an immutable public ledger. See the GDPR Position Paper for more details.","title":"Permissioned Write Access"},{"location":"gf_legal/legal_arch/#public-write-access","text":"Under Public Write Access policies, the requirement of a Transaction Endorser signing a Transaction Authors request is eliminated; anyone would be able to write to the Ledger by following a programmatic process that aims to provide the necessary assurances against privacy compliance risks.
